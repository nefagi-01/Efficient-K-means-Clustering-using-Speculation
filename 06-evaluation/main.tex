\subsection{Datasets}

\subsection{Convergence and Algorithm Comparison}

Describe all the work until now (even python is ok, we are looking for different behaviors, algorithms, parameters, setups). Here we validate that algorithm works conceptually.

\subsection{Resources and Execution Time}

Here we discuss in more detail about the hardware performance. You can mention python performance here too, but we would like to focus, if there is time, on scaling up, and resource allocation, and how this behaves in a parallel speculative case.

\subsection{End-to-end execution time}

If possible, run everything together (e.g. not piece by piece, but in a single run, everything configured, eventually with different parameters or adaptively)
