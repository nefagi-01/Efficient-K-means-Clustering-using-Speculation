Flow for the introduction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe at a high level what is the k-means algorithm
    \item Description of the steps of k-means and the dependencies between them
    \item Why/how does sampling help improve performance and what can go wrong if you just run k-means with a sample (basically set the stage to say why repairing is necessary)
    \item What do we propose (high-level description of the algorithm, how does it improve performance, how does it guarantee/help convergence)
\end{itemize}
