The purpose of this section is to set exactly our goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item performance
    \item accuracy (convergence, avoid getting stack to local optima)
\end{itemize}

Explain why existing approaches do not achieve both the above points.

Naive k-means is slow but does not guarantee convergence. Better initialization helps to achieve convergence, but it is hard to find good initialization. Approximate k-means can be very fast the smaller the sample but sacrifices correctness.

We could use in this section some figure/example to explain the above points.
